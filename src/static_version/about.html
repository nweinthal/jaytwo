        and archeological dig areas retain their natural beauty for the future enjoyment of all visitors.

        Though a tiny island, St John is home to over 50 of the most beautiful beaches in the world, where visitors can
        enjoy paddle boarding, tennis, kayaking, parasailing, day sails, horseback riding, fishing, scuba diving 
        or just relaxing in the sun. Just a short walk from J2O at Grande Bay Resort, 
        guests will also find a shopper’s paradise featuring locally made jewelry, gifts, art and resort wear.
        </p>
        <p>
        From casual to fine dining, St John offers endless restaurant possibilities as well as full service markets.  
        We are always happy to assist in provisioning J2O for your stay.
